Preparing a Personal Developer Instance for CCW 4225 - Getting Started with Istanbul Automated Testing Framework


Step 1 - Upload the three Update Sets: MediaLibrary-1.0.0.xml, MediaLibraryUpdate.xml, and MediaLibraryBreakingChanges.xml

Step 2 - Preview and commit these two update sets in this order: MediaLibrary-1.0.0.xml and MediaLibraryUpdate.xml. Do NOT commit MediaLibraryBreakingChanges.xml at this time, you will do this as part of the lab.

Step 3 - Import the data contained in the files x_snc_media_librar_copy.xml and x_snc_media_librar_media.xml. This are a few demo records that will make it easier to perform the tasks in the lab.

At this point you are ready to work through the lab. Any issues, feel free to reach out to dave.slusher@servicenow.com. Thank you!
